"Hangman Game"

Design a text-based Hangman game. The program
selects a random word, and the player guesses one
letter at a time to uncover the word. You can set a
limit on the number of incorrect guesses allowed.

Program:

import random

# List of words
words = ["python", "hangman", "computer", "program", "challenge"]

# Choose a random word
word_to_guess = random.choice(words).lower()  # Ensure lowercase
print("DEBUG: The word to guess is:", word_to_guess)  # Debugging line

# Initialize variables
guessed_letters = []
incorrect_guesses = 0
max_attempts = 6
word_display = ["_"] * len(word_to_guess)

print("Welcome to Hangman!")

# Game loop
while incorrect_guesses < max_attempts and "_" in word_display:
    print("\nWord to guess:", " ".join(word_display))
    print(f"Incorrect guesses left: {max_attempts - incorrect_guesses}")
    guess = input("Enter a letter: ").lower()  # Convert input to lowercase

    if len(guess) != 1 or not guess.isalpha():
        print("Please enter a single valid letter!")
        continue

    if guess in guessed_letters:
        print("You already guessed that letter!")
    elif guess in word_to_guess:
        print("Good guess!")
        guessed_letters.append(guess)
        for i, letter in enumerate(word_to_guess):
            if letter == guess:
                word_display[i] = guess
    else:
        print("Wrong guess!")
        guessed_letters.append(guess)
        incorrect_guesses += 1

# Check win or lose
if "_" not in word_display:
    print("\nCongratulations! You guessed the word:", word_to_guess)
else:
    print("\nYou lost! The word was:", word_to_guess)


output:
DEBUG: The word to guess is: hangman
Welcome to Hangman!

Word to guess: _ _ _ _ _ _ _
Incorrect guesses left: 6
Enter a letter:  h
